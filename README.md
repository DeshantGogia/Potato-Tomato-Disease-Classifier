# Potato-Tomato-Disease-Classifier
This project is an end to end potato and a tomato plant(leaf) disease classifier, which takes an input of an image of size 256x256,  the image should be of a potato or a tomato plant leaf image and then the CNN model classifies the leaf into a specific category on which the model is trained upon, their are 3 categories for potato and 10 for tomato.
Potato Plant Categories = [Potato-Early Blight, Potato-Late Blight, Potato-Healthy]
Tomato Plant Categories = ['Tomato_Bacterial_spot', 'Tomato_Early_blight', 'Tomato_Late_blight', 'Tomato_Leaf_Mold', 'Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot', 'Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite', 'Tomato__Target_Spot', 'Tomato__Tomato_YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus', 'Tomato__Tomato_mosaic_virus', 'Tomato_healthy']

Used Data Augmentation, Convolutional Layers and Max Pooling to perform the model training.
